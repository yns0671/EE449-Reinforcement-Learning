# Reinforcement Learning: Maze and LunarLander

This project implements reinforcement learning algorithms for METU EE449 Computational Intelligence Homework 2, focusing on maze navigation and LunarLander-v3 control tasks.  
The implementation uses Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Gymnasium, and PyTorch.

## ðŸ§  Contents

### Part 1: Maze Navigation with Temporal Difference (TD) Learning  
Modeling a stochastic maze environment and solving it using TD(0) learning with NumPy.

### Part 2: LunarLander-v3 Control with Deep Q-Networks (DQN)  
Training a DQN agent in PyTorch for the LunarLander-v3 environment using an Îµ-greedy policy and hyperparameter tuning.
